# cute
Java based IDE created for senior project many moons ago. Uploading this to serve mainly as a reminder to how far I've come and to be nicer to individuals who are still wet behind the ears so to speak.

## Goals

1. Tabbed project structure so that each projects files lives within its own workspace.
2. Lots of cool UI effects :)
3. Be able to execute ruby files from within the IDE.
4. Implement all modern shortcut keys to navigate between files/projects/etc without having to use a mouse.
